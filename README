Not a good sample of what an Android app should look like but what some *very* simple (probably
incorrect) Otto lint checks might look like.

Useful commands:
  Builds the Otto Lint checks:
    ./gradlew :OttoChecks:build
  Links the built lint check to where the lint check will be found (lame!):
    ln ~/git/LintDemo/SickAppProject/OttoChecks/build/libs/OttoChecks-1.0.jar OttoChecks-1.0.jar
  Runs the lint checks against the sickly app:
    ./gradlew :SickApp:build :SickApp:lint
  Views the generated lint report:
    ~/git/LintDemo/SickAppProject/SickApp/build/lint/ReleaseOutput.html
